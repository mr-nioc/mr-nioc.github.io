## Certified Idiots

Sometimes idiots publicly document their stupidity in so-called peer reviewed journals. Such publications give them pride because of the well documented certificates approved by professional idiots.

Warning!!!

This site is for your entertainment primarily. DO NOT take these posts too seriously and DO NOT attack anyone at a personal level. Here, we only talk about science. If you follow these rules, you may learn a thing or two, maybe.

Here, we anonymize those applicants names by a case number, for example something like CI#007, to protect their privary. Again, we DO NOT attack people here. We only evaluate their application material, and either approve or disapprove their application for certification based on our [guidelines](#guidelines).

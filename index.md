## Certified Idiots

Sometimes idiots publicly document their stupidity in articles submitted to so-called peer reviewed journals. Such publications give them pride because of the well documented evidence approved by professional idiots.

_Warning!!!_

This site is for your entertainment primarily. DO NOT take these posts too seriously and DO NOT attack anyone at a personal level. Here, we only talk about science. If you follow these rules, you may learn a thing or two, maybe.

Here, we anonymize those applicants names by a case number, for example something like CI#007, to protect their privary. Again, we DO NOT attack people here. We only evaluate their application material, and either approve or disapprove their application for certification based on our [guidelines](#guidelines).

## Guidelines
Applicants meeting any one of the following shall be certified:
1. A fundamental error in logic. For example, `4*4=4+4`. However, arithmatic errors, typos in the formulae DO NOT count.
2. Unfalsifiable statements. For example, the earth has 2 moons and the second moon is made of some material that can not be detected by humans.

Evidence of the following categories are not counted:
1. Grammatical errors of any sort.
2. Typos of any sort.
3. Errors or mistakes that can be easily corrected. By "easily", we mean in less than 20 words in humanly understandable English.
4. Mediocrity does not count.
5. Tweets do not count. Each primary document should at least have a DOI number.

Once certified, they do not need to submit further evidence to keep their status for __5__ years. After the initial 5 years, new evidence shall be considered. Anyone can submit new evidence for continuing certification on their behalf. If re-certified, they will be inducted to [the hall of fame](#hall_of_fame), and no further documentation is needed.
